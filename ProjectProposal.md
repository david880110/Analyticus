<p><b>Can Twitter be used to determine influenza outbreaks?</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Problem:</b>  Localized flu vaccine shortages while sufficient supply nationwide.  There is a need to predict influenza outbreakes.</li>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
There have been recent concerns regarding flu vaccinations, flu outbreaks, and supplies of flu shots.
</p>
<p>
The purpose of this project is to determine if Twitter can be used to predict flu outbreaks, thus mitigating recent concerns.
<p>The Center Disease Control (CDC) publishes "PERCENTAGE OF VISITS FOR INFLUENZA-LIKE-ILLNESS REPORTED BY SENTINEL PROVIDERS" 
from their "FluView" website (https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html).  This will be the government input. This 
will be for the period Week 40, 2017 through Week 11, 2018.
</p>
<p>
Tweets for the same period will be selected.  The selection criteria will be phrases indicating that person has ILI or knows
of someone who does.  
</p>
<p>
The Twitter source will be plotted against the CDC source.  
</p>
<p>
At that time a determination will be made if a correlation between Twitter and ILI exists.
